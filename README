README - Agent
--------------


DESCRIPTION
-----------
Agent is a generic solution to greatly simplify the agent programming
(see java.lang.instrument package description for more information about agents in general).

The main idea is to have a totally separated environment for running agents. This means that
the agent uses its own namespace (i.e. class loader) for its classes. With Agent a programmer
can avoid .jar file version conflicts. That's why the Agent configuration file has its own
classpath element. Another advantage is that the XML configuration file is always similar
for different agents. And yet one more advantage is that the programmer does not need to care
about the manifest attributes mentioned java.lang.instrument package description. They are
already handled for the programmer.

REQUIREMENTS
------------
- Java 1.5 or later
